npm i -g protractor
webdriver-manager update
webdriver-manager start

Download the extension to start in the browser.

Search the extension modheader: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/modheader/idgpnmonknjnojddfkpgkljpfnnfcklj?hl=es

To do this there are two ways, for example using the .crx file but in this tutorial we are going to use the files of the extension.

So we have to install the extension in the browser.

chrome://version/

Ctrl + Shift + G
Search ~/Library
Application Support -> Google -> Chrome -> Default -> Extensions

chrome://extensions/
Activate the developer mode
Copy the extension id
Go to the path:
Application Support -> Google -> Chrome -> Default -> Extensions
