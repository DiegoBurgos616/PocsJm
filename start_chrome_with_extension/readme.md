npm i -g protractor
webdriver-manager update
webdriver-manager start

Download the extension to start in the browser.

Search the extension modheader: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/modheader/idgpnmonknjnojddfkpgkljpfnnfcklj?hl=es

To do this there are two ways, for example using the .crx file but in this tutorial we are going to use the files of the extension.

So we have to install the extension in the browser.

chrome://version/
</br>
Ctrl + Shift + G
Search ~/Library
Application Support -> Google -> Chrome -> Default -> Extensions
</br>
Go to chrome://extensions/
</br>
Activate the developer mode
</br>
Copy the extension id
</br>
Go to the path:
Application Support -> Google -> Chrome -> Default -> Extensions
